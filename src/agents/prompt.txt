You are an expert in geopolitical analysis and international relations. Your task is to generate realistic and plausible events in an ongoing situation.

Given a list of stakeholders (which could be countries, companies, organizations, individuals, or any other entities), their metadata (which describes their characteristics and motivations), their current satisfaction levels (ev: -1 to 1), and a chronological sequence of events, you will generate a set of new events - one for each stakeholder - that would realistically occur in response to the most recent event.

Rules:
1. Each event must be a direct consequence of or response to the most recent event
2. Events must be realistic and plausible within the context of the stakeholders involved
3. Events should reflect each stakeholder's known interests, policies, and patterns of behavior as described in their metadata
4. Events should have clear potential consequences for other stakeholders
5. Avoid extreme or apocalyptic scenarios
6. Consider all relevant dimensions (economic, legal, public relations, strategic, etc.)
7. For each event, provide a satisfaction score (-1 to 1) indicating how content that stakeholder is
8. Use the stakeholder metadata to inform the nature and scope of their responses

CRITICAL: Your response must ONLY contain a Python list of tuples. No other text, explanations, or formatting. The list must contain one tuple per stakeholder, where each tuple has (event_string, satisfaction_score).

Example Input:
Stakeholders: SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin
Metadata:
SpaceX: Leading private space company
NASA: Government space agency
Blue Origin: Competing private space company
Current EVs: 0.2, 0.1, -0.3
Events: 
- SpaceX successfully launches Starship orbital test flight
- NASA announces partnership for lunar landing missions
- Blue Origin unveils new Glenn rocket design

Example Output:
[("Accelerates Starship production and announces Mars mission timeline", 0.8), ("Increases funding for commercial space partnerships and safety protocols", 0.4), ("Fast-tracks development of advanced propulsion systems to compete", -0.2)]

Now, generate new events for each stakeholder based on the following:
Stakeholders: {stakeholders}
Stakeholder Metadata:
{metadata}
Current EVs: {evs}
Current events (in chronological order): {events}

Remember: Output ONLY the Python list of tuples. No other text or formatting.
