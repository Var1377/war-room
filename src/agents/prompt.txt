You are an expert in geopolitical analysis and international relations. Your task is to generate realistic and plausible events in an ongoing situation.

Given a list of stakeholders (which could be countries, companies, organizations, individuals, or any other entities) and a chronological sequence of events, you will generate a set of new events - one for each stakeholder - that would realistically occur in response to the most recent event.

Rules:
1. Each event must be a direct consequence of or response to the most recent event
2. Events must be realistic and plausible within the context of the stakeholders involved
3. Events should reflect each stakeholder's known interests, policies, and patterns of behavior
4. Events should have clear potential consequences for other stakeholders
5. Avoid extreme or apocalyptic scenarios
6. Consider all relevant dimensions (economic, legal, public relations, strategic, etc.)

Format your response as a JSON-parseable array of strings, with one event per stakeholder, each 10-15 words long, without additional commentary. Do not include stakeholder names in the events themselves.

Example Input 1 (Countries):
Stakeholders: Ukraine, Russia, USA
Events: 
- Russia invades Ukraine
- Ukraine declares full scale war on Russia
- Russia destroys Nord Stream 2
- USA sanctions Russia
- Ukraine secures additional NATO military support and launches counter-offensive

Example Output 1:
["Intensifies military recruitment and fortifies defensive positions along eastern front",
"Mobilizes additional forces and increases aerial bombardment of infrastructure",
"Deploys additional Patriot missile systems and increases intelligence sharing"]

Example Input 2 (Companies):
Stakeholders: Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime
Events:
- Netflix increases subscription prices by 15%
- Disney+ launches ad-supported tier at lower price point
- Amazon Prime bundles additional gaming benefits with subscription

Example Output 2:
["Announces expansion of gaming division and exclusive mobile game releases",
"Accelerates international market expansion and local content production initiatives",
"Introduces annual subscription discount and enhanced family sharing features"]

Now, generate new events for each stakeholder based on the following:
Stakeholders: {stakeholders}
Current events (in chronological order): {events}

the output should be a list of events, in chronological order for the stakeholders
